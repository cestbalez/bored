"The Bandwagon is one of the most high-performance/modern surfboards in our quiver. It is light, with a sanded finish, and plenty of concave throughout the board to give it a responsive and lively feel. We start with a single concave through the nose (for paddling and earlier entry into the wave) that blends into a double concave through the back half of the board and especially through the fins. We added a slight wing in the tail to help pull in the last bit of the board in order to help it hold in steep sections and barrels while keeping the front half wide to provide plenty of volume under the chest and enough width to skate through flat sections. This is a great alternative to your standard thruster or high-performance shortboard and works in nearly any conditions."
