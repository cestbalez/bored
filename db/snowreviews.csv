"K2 does it again with the Cool Bean. Downsize your traditional board length for maximum fun. The profile is very much set back which allows you to float through any depth of powder. Extremely maneuverable; my go to for getting after powder in the trees. Responsive on hardpack and groomers as well.","As I get older I'm more into cruising and just flowing rather than attempting airborne tricks (don't want to hurt myself again!). This snowboard is so perfect for surfing down the mountain. I initially thought there would be a bit of a learning curve since the shape is dramatically different from any board I had ever rode previously, but it feels surprisingly normal. In powder (even super deep powder) the swallow tail sinks naturally while the fat nose keeps you on top which makes riding feel effortless. On groomers it holds a solid edge and is still super fun. Having big feet (size 13), I especially appreciate the extra width! Less toe drag is always a plus. I highly recommend this board","The K2 Cool Bean is by far my favorite powder board that I've ever ridden. Coming in at some insanely short sizes (138cm, 144cm, 150cm), your first impression is that the small Cool Bean won't be able to hold it's own in the deep stuff. That's where you're wrong. With an insanely wide waist width, huge rockered nose, and flat camber profile the rest of the way, the Bean floats like a dream and is more stable than marrying rich. It takes some getting used to, but once you do you can still feel confident dropping cliffs and getting air. Use that big nose to your advantage and don't land backseat! "
